### Vignette Abstract:

A brief description in a few sentences of your vignette topic, example data, and outcomes.

For our PSTAT 197A Final vignette, we wanted to take a deep dive into Artificial Neural Network Architecture and how different architectures affect the model outcomes.

Our example data is the abalone dataset built into R, containing data on 4177 abalones. The dataset include predictor variables such as type (male, female, or infant), diameter, height, longest shell measurements, number of rings, and various weights. Our response variable, and what we are trying to predict, is the age of the abalone. This response variable can be calculated by adding 1.5 to the number of rings, meaning we are working with a supervised dataset.

Our outcomes of our exploration were as follows (note how changes of each of these affect the outcome of the model):

Epochs:

Validation Split:
